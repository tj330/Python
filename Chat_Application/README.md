# A simple terminal based Chat Application 
How to execute locally on your machine:

    Clone the repo
    Execute command "python -r requirements.txt" for installing the necessary modules
    Open two terminal tabs of the Chat_Application repository
    Execute server.py file by "python server.py" in the first tab and 
    Execute client.py file by "python client.py" in the second terminal tab
    Now you can simply chat as the server and user

  Here socket module is used:<br/>
  Socket is a connection endpoint (traffic destination) which is on one side associated with the host machine's IP address and the port number of the application for which the socket was created, and on the other, it is associated to the IP address and the port of the application running on another machine to which the connection is established.<br/>
  TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) is used in this project. We can also use UDP(User Datagram Protocol) instead.
